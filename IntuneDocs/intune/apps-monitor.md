# Monitor app information and assignments with Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Intune provides several ways to monitor the properties of apps that you manage and to manage app assignment status.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **All services** > **Intune**. Intune is located in the **Monitoring + Management** section.
3. In the **Intune** menu, select **Mobile apps**.
4. In the **Manage** section of the menu, select **Apps**.
5. In the list of apps, select an app to monitor. You'll then see the app pane, which includes an overview of the device status and the user status.

> [!NOTE]
> Android Store apps that are deployed as **Available** do not report their installation status.
