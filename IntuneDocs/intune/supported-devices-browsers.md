# Supported operating systems and browsers

[!INCLUDE [both-portals](./includes/note-for-both-portals.md)]

Before setting up Microsoft Intune, review the supported operating systems and browsers.

For help installing Intune on your device, see [using managed devices to get work done](/intune-user-help/company-portal-frequently-asked-questions). You should also familiarize yourself with [Intune network bandwidth usage](network-bandwidth-use.md) ([classic portal](/intune-classic/get-started/network-bandwidth-use)).

## Intune supported operating systems

You can manage devices running the following operating systems:

[!INCLUDE [mdm-supported-devices](./includes/mdm-supported-devices.md)]

### Supported Samsung Knox Standard devices

The Company Portal app only attempts Samsung Knox activation during MDM enrollment if the device appears in the [list of supported Knox devices](https://www.samsungknox.com/knox-supported-devices/knox-workspace). This helps avoid Knox activation errors that prevent MDM enrollment. Devices that don't support Samsung Knox activation enroll as standard Android devices. A Samsung device might have some model numbers that support Knox, while others don't. Verify Knox compatibility with your device reseller before you purchase and deploy Samsung devices.

> [!NOTE]
> Enrolling Samsung Knox devices may require you to [enable access to Samsung servers](https://support.samsungknox.com/hc/articles/115013833108-Our-corporate-devices-are-behind-a-firewall-How-do-I-enable-Knox-Workspace-devices-to-contact-Samsung-servers). 

The following list of Samsung device models do not support Knox and are enrolled as native Android devices by the Company Portal app for Android:

### Windows PC software client

An [Intune software client](/intune-classic/deploy-use/manage-windows-pcs-with-microsoft-intune) can be deployed and installed on Windows PCs as an alternate enrollment method. This functionality is only available using the Intune classic portal. You can use the Intune software client to manage Windows 7 and later PCs with the exception of Windows 10 Home edition.

<!--  ### Exchange ActiveSync management

You can manage [Exchange ActiveSync devices](/intune-classic/deploy-use/mobile-device-management-with-exchange-activesync-and-microsoft-intune) from the Intune console. This option provides a limited set of management capabilities when compared to the other methods. See [Capabilities of built-in Mobile Device Management in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Capabilities-of-built-in-Mobile-Device-Management-for-Office-365-a1da44e5-7475-4992-be91-9ccec25905b0) for a list of supported devices.  -->

## Intune supported web browsers

Different administrative tasks require that you use one of the following administrative websites.

- [Office 365 portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=698854)

The following browsers are supported for these portals:

### Intune classic portal

Intune classic-only features, such as Intune PC software client and integration with Mobile Threat Defense partners, are only available in the Intune classic portal (https://manage.microsoft.com). The Intune classic portal requires Silverlight browser support.

The following Silverlight browsers support the Intune console:
- Internet Explorer 10 or later
- Google Chrome (versions prior to version 42)
- Mozilla Firefox with Silverlight enabled [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=836872)

> [!Note]
> Microsoft Edge and mobile browsers are not supported for the Intune classic portal because they do not support [Microsoft Silverlight](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc838158(v=vs.95).aspx).

Only users with service administrator permissions or tenant administrators with the global administrator role can sign in to this portal. To access the administration console, your account must have a license to use Intune and a sign-in status of **Allowed**.
