# Set the mobile device management authority

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

The mobile device management (MDM) authority setting determines how you manage your devices. As an IT admin, you must set an MDM authority before users can enroll devices for management.

Possible configurations are:

- **Intune Standalone** - cloud-only management, which you configure by using the Azure portal. Includes the full set of capabilities that Intune offers. [Set the MDM authority in the Intune console](#set-mdm-authority-to-intune).

- **Intune Hybrid** - integration of the Intune cloud solution with System Center Configuration Manager. You configure Intune by using the Configuration Manager console. [Set the MDM authority in Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/mdm/deploy-use/configure-intune-subscription).

- **Mobile Device Management for Office 365** - integration of Office 365 with the Intune cloud solution. You configure Intune from your Office 365 Admin Center. Includes a subset of the capabilities that are available with Intune Standalone. Set the MDM authority in Office 365 Admin Center.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Configuration Manager version 1610 or later and Microsoft Intune version 1705, you change the MDM authority without having to contact Microsoft Support, and without having to unenroll and reenroll your existing managed devices. For details, see [What to do if you choose the wrong MDM authority setting](/intune-classic/deploy-use/prerequisites-for-enrollment#what-to-do-if-you-choose-the-wrong-mdm-authority-setting).

## Set MDM authority to Intune

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Choose **All services** > **Intune**. Intune is located in the **Monitoring + Management** section.
3. Select the orange banner to open the **Mobile Device Management Authority** setting.
4. Under **Mobile Device Management Authority**, choose your MDM authority from the following options:
   - **Intune MDM Authority**
   - **Configuration Manager MDM Authority**
   - **None**

   A message indicates that you have successfully set your MDM authority to Intune.

## Enable device enrollment

With Intune set as your MDM authority, users can enroll personally owned devices and gain access to resources like email in the following ways by installing the Company Portal (iOS, macOS, and Android), adding work credentials (Windows), or accessing the Company Portal website (iOS, Android, macOS).

Different platforms have the following requirements to enable or simplify enrollment:
- **iOS** - (required) [Get an Apple MDM push certificate](apple-mdm-push-certificate-get.md) and then [enable enrollment for company-owned iOS devices](ios-enroll.md) (optional).
- **Android** - (optional) [Enable Android work profiles](android-enroll.md)
- **Windows** - (optional) Enable [Automatic enrollment](windows-enroll.md) or [bulk enrollment](windows-bulk-enroll.md)
- **macOS** - (required) [Get an Apple MDM Push Certificate](apple-mdm-push-certificate-get.md).

### Workflow of Intune Administration UI
When Android or Apple device management is enabled, Intune sends device and user information to integrate with these 3rd party services to manage their respective devices.

Scenarios that add a consent to share data are included when:
- You enable Android for Work.
- You enable and upload Apple MDM push certificates.
- You Enable any of the Apple services, such as Device Enrollment Program, School Manager, or Volume Purchasing Program.

In each case, the consent is strictly related to running a mobile device management service, such as confirming that an IT Admin has authorized Google or Apple devices to enroll. Documentation to address what information is shared when the new workflows go live is available from the following locations:
- [Data Intune sends to Google](https://aka.ms/Data-intune-sends-to-google)
- [Data Intune sends to Apple](https://aka.ms/data-intune-sends-to-apple)

For more information on Microsoftâ€™s GDPR compliance, see [Trust Center - Assess your GDPR compliance](https://aka.ms/trust_center_info).

## Mobile device cleanup after MDM certificate expiration

The MDM certificate is renewed automatically when mobile devices are communicating with the Intune service. If mobile devices are wiped, or they fail to communicate with the Intune service for some period of time, the MDM certificate will not get renewed. The device is removed from the Azure portal 180 days after the MDM certificate expires.
