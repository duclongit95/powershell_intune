# Evaluate how many users are targeted by a policy
[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

You can use the **Evaluate** button to find out how many users are targeted by a device compliance or device configuration policy. This feature only calculates users, not devices.

1.	In [Intune in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/intuneportal), choose **Device compliance** or **Device configuration**, and then choose **Policies**.
2.	Choose one of the policies, or create a new one, and then choose **Assignments**.
3.	Choose **Evaluate**. A message displays showing you how many users are targeted by this policy.

If the **Evaluate** button is grayed out, make sure that the policy has been assigned to one or more groups.
