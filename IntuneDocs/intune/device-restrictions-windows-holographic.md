- 	**Trusted app installation** - Allows apps signed with a trusted certificate to be sideloaded.
- 	**Developer unlock** - Allow Windows developer settings, such as allowing sideloaded apps to be modified by the end user.

## Edge Browser

## Control Panel and Settings

- **System Time modification** - Prevents the end user from changing the device date and time.

## Kiosk

A kiosk device typically runs a specific app. Users are prevented from accessing any features or functions on the device outside of the kiosk app.

- **Kiosk mode** - Identifies the type of kiosk mode supported by the policy. Options include:

  - **Not Configured** (default) - The policy does not enable a kiosk mode. 
  - **Single app kiosk** - The profile enables the device to only run one app. When the user signs in, a specific app starts. This mode also restricts the user from opening new apps, or changing the running app.
  - **Multi-app kiosk** - The profile enables the device to run multiple apps. Only the apps you add are available to the user. The benefit of a multi-app kiosk, or fixed-purpose device, is to provide an easy-to-understand experience for individuals by only accessing apps they need. And, removing the apps they donâ€™t need from their view. 
  
    When you add apps for a multi-app kiosk experience, you also add a start menu layout file. [Start menu layout file](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-kiosk#start-layout-file-for-intune) includes sample XML that can be used in Intune. 

#### Single app kiosks
Enter the following settings:

- **User account** - Enter the local (to the device) user account or the Azure AD account login associated with the kiosk app. For accounts joined to Azure AD domains, enter the account using the `domain\username@tenant.org` format. 

    For kiosks in public-facing environments with auto logon enabled, a user type with the least privilege (such as the local standard user account) should be used. To configure an Azure Active Directory (AD) account for kiosk mode, use the `AzureAD\user@contoso.com` format.

- **Application user model ID (AUMID) of app** - Enter the AUMID of the kiosk app. To learn more, see [Find the Application User Model ID of an installed app](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/customize/enterprise/find-the-application-user-model-id-of-an-installed-app).

## Reporting and Telemetry

- **Share usage data** - Select level of diagnostic data submission.
