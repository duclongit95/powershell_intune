# Introduction to Microsoft Intune in the Azure portal


[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Similar to other Azure services, Microsoft Intune is available in the Azure portal. By selecting **Intune** within the Azure portal, you can manage your organization's mobile devices, PCs, and apps.

> [!NOTE]
> If you've used a previous version of Microsoft Intune, you may find the following information helpful:
>     * [Where did my features go in Azure?](ui-changes.md) is a reference to show you the specific workflows and UIs that have changed with the move to Azure.
>     * [Intune classic groups in the Azure portal](groups-get-started.md) explains the implications of the shift to Azure Active Directory security groups for group management.

Highlights of the Microsoft Intune experience in the Azure portal include:

- An integrated console for all your Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) components
- An HTML-based console built on web standards
- Microsoft Graph API support to automate many actions
- Azure Active Directory (AD) groups to provide compatibility across all your Azure applications
- Support for most modern web browsers

## Before you start

To use Intune in the Azure portal, you must have an Intune admin and tenant account. [Sign up for an account](https://portal.office.com/Signup/Signup.aspx?OfferId=40BE278A-DFD1-470a-9EF7-9F2596EA7FF9&dl=INTUNE_A&ali=1#0%20) if you don't already have one.
