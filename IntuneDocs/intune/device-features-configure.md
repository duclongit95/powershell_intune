# Add iOS or macOS device feature settings in Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Device features let you control a range of settings and features on iOS and macOS devices, such as:

- AirPrint and AirPlay settings
- Home screen layout
- Notifications from apps
- Shared device configuration
- Setting up single sign-on
- Filtering web content

This article shows you the basics on configuring iOS device feature profiles. Then, you can step through additional articles to configure platform-specific settings for your devices.

## Create a device profile

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **All services**, filter on **Intune**, and then select **Microsoft Intune**.
3. Select **Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile**.
4. Enter the following properties:

   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the new profile.
   - **Description**: Enter a description for the profile. (This is optional, but recommended.)
   - **Platform**: Select your platform type:
     - **iOS**
     - **macOS**
   - **Profile type**: Select **Device features**.
   - **Settings**: The settings depend on the platform you choose. The following articles describe the settings for each profile type:

     - [AirPrint settings for iOS and MacOS](air-print-settings-ios-macos.md)
     - [AirPlay settings for iOS](airplay-settings-ios.md)
     - [Home screen layout settings for iOS](home-screen-settings-ios.md)
     - [App notification settings for iOS](app-notification-settings-ios.md)
     - [Shared device configuration settings for iOS](shared-device-settings-ios.md)
     - [Configure Intune for iOS device single sign-on](sso-ios.md)
     - [Web content filter settings for iOS](web-content-filter-settings-ios.md)

5. When you're done, select **OK**, and choose **Create** to save your changes.

The profile is created, and appears in the list.
