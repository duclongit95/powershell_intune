# Customize devices running Windows Holographic with Intune

Microsoft Intune supports devices running Windows Holographic for Business, such as the [Microsoft HoloLens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/).

To manage devices that run Windows Holographic with Microsoft Intune, you must create an Edition Upgrade profile. This upgrade profile upgrades the devices from Windows Holographic to Windows Holographic for Business. For the Microsoft HoloLens, you can buy the Commercial Suite to get the required license for the upgrade. For more information, see [Upgrade devices running Windows Holographic to Windows Holographic for Business](holographic-upgrade.md).

To help manage and customize your devices running Windows Holographic for Business, you can use the tasks in this article. For example, you can manage software updates, configure VPN settings, and more.

## Azure Active Directory

Azure Active Directory (AD) is a great resource to help manage and control your devices running Windows Holographic for Business. Using Intune and Azure AD, you can: 

- **[Set up Azure Active Directory joined devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/device-management-azuread-joined-devices-setup)**: In Azure Active Directory (AD), you can add your work-owned Windows 10 devices, including devices running Windows Holographic for Business. This feature allows Azure AD to control the device. It helps confirm that users are accessing the company resources from devices that meet your security and compliance standards.

  [Introduction to device management in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/device-management-introduction) provides more details.

- **[Bulk enrollment for Windows devices](windows-bulk-enroll.md)**: You can join large numbers of new Windows devices to Azure Active Directory (AD) and Intune. This feature is called bulk enrollment, and uses provisioning packages. These packages join the devices running Windows Holographic for Business to your Azure AD tenant, and enrolls them in Intune.

## Company Portal
**[Configure the Company Portal app](company-portal-app.md)**

Intune provides the Company Portal app for users to access company data, enroll devices, install apps, contact their IT department, and more. You can customize the Company Portal app for your devices running Windows Holographic for Business.

Using the Company Portal app, you can also run the following actions:

- [Remove a device from Intune](/intune-user-help/unenroll-your-device-from-intune-windows) using the Settings app or the Company Portal app
- [Rename a device](/intune-user-help/rename-your-device-cpapp)
- [Install apps](/intune-user-help/install-apps-cpapp-windows) on a device
- [Sync devices manually](/intune-user-help/sync-your-device-manually-windows) from the Settings app or the Company Portal app


## Compliance policy
**[Create a device compliance policy](compliance-policy-create-windows.md)**

Compliance policies are rules and settings that devices must meet to be compliant. Use these policies with conditional access to block access to company resources for devices that are not-compliant. In Intune, create compliance policies to allow or block access for devices running Windows Holographic for Business. For example, you can create a policy that requires Bitlocker be enabled.

See also **[Get started with compliance policies](device-compliance-get-started.md)**.

## Deploy and manage apps
**[Add apps to Intune](apps-add.md)**

Using Intune, you can add apps to your devices running Windows Holographic for Business. There are many ways to deploy apps, including:

- [Add Microsoft Store apps](store-apps-windows.md)
- [Add apps you create](lob-apps-windows.md)
- [Assign apps to groups](apps-deploy.md)

Microsoft Intune can deploy Universal Windows Apps to Microsoft HoloLens devices running Windows Holographic for Business. You can directly upload your app packages in the Intune Azure portal, or deploy them from the Microsoft Store for Business. For more information about related areas, see the following articles:
- To deploy Line-of-Business (LOB) apps using the Intune Azure portal, see [How to add Windows line-of-business apps to Microsoft Intune](lob-apps-windows.md).
- To deploy apps using the Microsoft Store for Business, see [How to manage apps you purchased from the Microsoft Store for Business with Microsoft Intune](windows-store-for-business.md). 
- To learn about app management with Microsoft Intune, see [What is app management in Microsoft Intune](app-management.md).
- To learn more about developing apps for Microsoft HoloLens, see [Mixed reality apps for Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/hololens/apps). 

> [!NOTE]
> HoloLens devices running Windows 10 Holographic for Business 1607 don't support online-licensed apps from the Microsoft Store for Business. To learn more, see [Install apps on HoloLens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/hololens-install-apps).

## Device actions
Intune has some built-in actions that allow IT administrators to do different tasks, locally on the device, or remotely using Intune in the Azure portal. Users can also issue a remote command from the Intune Company Portal to personally owned devices that are enrolled in Intune.

When using devices running Windows Holographic for Business, the following actions can be used: 

- **[Factory reset](devices-wipe.md#factory-reset)**: The **Factory reset** action removes the device from Intune, and restores the device back to its factory default settings. Use this action before giving the device to a new user, or when the device is lost or stolen.

- **[Remove company data](devices-wipe.md#remove-company-data)**: The **Remove company data** action removes the device from Intune. It also removes managed app data, settings, and email profiles assigned by Intune. The user's personal data stays on the device.

- **[Sync devices to get the latest policies and actions](device-sync.md)**: The **Sync** action forces the device to immediately check in with Intune. When a device checks in, the device immediately receives any pending actions or policies that are assigned. This feature helps you validate and troubleshoot policies youâ€™ve assigned, without waiting for the next scheduled check-in.

**[What is Microsoft Intune device management?](device-management.md)** is a good resource to learn about managing devices using the Azure portal. 

## Device categories and groups
**[Categorize devices into groups](device-group-mapping.md)**

Using Intune, you can create device categories to automatically add devices to groups based on categories that you create, such as Sales, Accounting, Human Resources, and so on. The idea is to make it easier to manage your devices running Windows Holographic for Business.

## Device configuration profiles 
**[Get started with configuration profiles](device-profiles.md), and [create your own profile](device-profile-create.md)**

Intune includes settings and features that you can enable or disable on different devices within your organization. These settings and features are managed using profiles. For example, you can create a profile that enables Cortana, or uses Windows Defender Smart Screen on your devices running Windows Holographic for Business.

In your profiles, you can use OMA-URI to customize some settings, create device restrictions, and configure a virtual private network (VPN) and Wi-Fi.

#### [Custom device settings](custom-settings-windows-holographic.md)

To configure OMA-URI (Open Mobile Alliance Uniform Resource Identifier) settings, you can create a custom profile in Intune. Use the OMA-URI settings to control different features on your Windows Holographic for Business devices, such as enabling VPN, or checking for updates on Microsoft Update.

#### [Device restrictions](device-restrictions-windows-holographic.md)

Device restrictions let you control different settings and features on your devices, including requiring a password, installing apps from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/windows?icid=CNavAppsWindowsApps), enabling Bluetooth, and more. These restrictions are created in an Intune profile. This profile can be applied to multiple devices running Windows Holographic for Business.

#### [Configure VPN](vpn-settings-configure.md)

Virtual private networks (VPNs) give your users secure remote access to your company network. In Intune, you can create a VPN profile that includes specific settings for your devices running Windows Holographic for Business. For example, you can create a VPN profile so all Windows Holographic for Business devices use Citrix VPN as the connection type.

#### [Configure Wi-Fi](wi-fi-settings-configure.md)

You can also create a Wi-Fi profile in Intune to assign wireless network settings to your Windows Holographic for Business devices. When you assign a Wi-Fi profile, your end users get corporate network access, without any network configuration. For example, you can create a Wi-Fi network dedicated to only your Windows Holographic for Business devices.

## Software updates
**[Manage software updates](windows-update-for-business-configure.md)**

Intune includes a feature called update rings for Windows 10 devices. These update rings include a group of settings that determine how updates are installed. For example, you can create a maintenance window to install updates, or choose to restart after updates are installed. An update ring can be applied to multiple devices running Windows Holographic for Business.

## Terms and conditions
**[Set your company's terms and conditions for user access](terms-and-conditions-create.md)**

Before users enroll devices and access your company apps, including email, you can require that users accept your company's terms and conditions. In Intune, define how the terms and conditions are shown in the Company Portal, and also assign these terms and conditions to devices running Windows Holographic for Business.

## Windows Hello for Business
**[Use Windows Hello for Business](windows-hello.md)**

Hello for Business is an alternative sign-in method that uses an Azure Active Directory account to replace a password, smart card, or a virtual smart card. With Hello for Business, your Windows Holographic for Business devices can sign in with a PIN with a minimum length set by you.
