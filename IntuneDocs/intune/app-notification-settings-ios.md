4. Enter the following properties:

   - **App bundle ID**: Enter the **App Bundle ID** of the app you want to configure. **Bundle ID reference for built-in iOS apps** (in this article) provides some help.
   - **App name**: Enter the name of the app you want to configure. This name is not displayed on the device and is used to help you identify the app in the list.
   - **Publisher**: Enter the publisher of the app you want to configure. The publisher name is not displayed on the device, and is used only to help you identify the app in the list.
   - **Notifications**: Enable or disable the app from sending notifications to the device. If you disable this setting, the following settings are also disabled.
     - **Show in Notification Center** - Enable this setting to allow the app to show notifications in the device Notification Center.
     - **Show in Lock Screen** - Enable this setting to see notifications from the app on the device lock screen.
     - **Alert type** - Select the type of notification you want when the device is unlocked from:
       - **None** - No notification is displayed.
       - **Banner** - A banner is briefly displayed showing the notification.
       - **Modal** - The notification is displayed and the user must manually dismiss it before you can continue to use the device.
     - **Badge on app icon** - Enable this setting to add a badge to the app icon to indicate the app sent a notification.
     - **Sounds** - Enable this setting to play a sound when a notification is delivered.

5. Continue to add as many apps as you need. When finished adding apps, select **OK**.
6. Select **Create** to save your profile.
