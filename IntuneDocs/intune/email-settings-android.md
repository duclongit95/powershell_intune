# Email profile settings in Microsoft Intune for devices running Android and Android for Work

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

This article shows you the email profile settings you can configure for your devices running Android.

As an Intune administrator, you can create and assign email settings to the following Android devices:
- [Android Samsung Knox Standard](#android-samsung-knox-standard-email-settings)
- [Android for Work](#android-for-work-email-settings)

## Android Samsung Knox Standard email settings
- **Email server** - The host name of your Exchange server.
- **Account name** - The display name for the email account as it appears to users on their devices.
- **Username attribute from AAD** - This name is the attribute in Active Directory (AD) or Azure AD used to generate the username for this email profile. Select **Primary SMTP Address**, such as user1@contoso.com or **User Principal Name**, such as user1 or user1@contoso.com.
- **Email address attribute from AAD** - How the email address for the user on each device is generated. Select **Primary SMTP Address** to use the primary SMTP address to log in to Exchange or use **User Principal Name** to use the full principal name as the email address.
- **Authentication method** - Select either **Username and Password** or **Certificates** as the authentication method used by the email profile.
	- If you selected **Certificate**, select a client SCEP or PKCS certificate profile that you previously created to authenticate the Exchange connection.

### Synchronization settings
