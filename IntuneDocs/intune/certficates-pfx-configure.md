# Configure and use PKCS certificates with Intune

[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Certificates are used to authenticate and secure access to your corporate resources, such as a VPN or your WiFi network. This article shows you how to export a PKCS certificate, and then add the certificate to an Intune profile. 

## Requirements

To use PKCS certificates with Intune, be sure you have the following infrastructure:

* An existing Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain configured.
 
  For more information about installing and configuring AD DS, see [AD DS Design and Planning](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/ad-ds-design-and-planning).

* An existing Enterprise Certification Authority (CA) configured.

  For more information on installing and configuring Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), see [Active Directory Certificate Services Step-by-Step Guide](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc772393).

  > [!WARNING]
  > Intune requires you to run AD CS with an Enterprise Certification Authority (CA), not a Standalone CA.

* A client that has connectivity to the Enterprise CA.
* An exported copy of your root certificate from your Enterprise CA.
* The Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector (NDESConnectorSetup.exe) downloaded from your Intune portal.
* A Windows Server to host the Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector (NDESConnectorSetup.exe).

## Export the root certificate from the Enterprise CA

To authenticate with VPN, WiFi, and other resources, a root or intermediate CA certificate is needed on each device. The following steps explain how to get the required certificate from your Enterprise CA.

1. Sign in to your Enterprise CA with an account that has administrative privileges.
2. Open a command prompt as an administrator.
3. Export the Root CA Certificate (.cer) to a location where you can access it later.

   For example:

4. After the wizard completes, but before closing the wizard, click **Launch the Certificate Connector UI**.

   `certutil -ca.cert certnew.cer`

   For more information, see [Certutil tasks for managing certificates](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc772898.aspx#BKMK_ret_sign).

## Configure certificate templates on the certification authority

1. Sign in to your Enterprise CA with an account that has administrative privileges.
2. Open the **Certification Authority** console, right-click **Certificate Templates**, and select **Manage**.
3. Locate the **User** certificate template, right-click it, and choose **Duplicate Template**. **Properties of New Template** opens.
4. On the **Compatibility** tab: 
   * Set **Certification Authority** to **Windows Server 2008 R2**
   * Set **Certificate recipient** to **Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2**
5. On the **General** tab:
   * Set **Template display name** to something meaningful to you.

   > [!WARNING]
   > **Template name** by default is the same as **Template display name** with *no spaces*. Note the template name, you need it later.

6. In **Request Handling**, select **Allow private key to be exported**.
7. In **Cryptography**, confirm that the **Minimum key size** is set to 2048.
8. In **Subject Name**, choose **Supply in the request**.
9. In **Extensions**, confirm that you see Encrypting File System, Secure Email, and Client Authentication under **Application Policies**.
    
      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > For iOS certificate templates, go to the **Extensions** tab, update **Key Usage**, and confirm that **Signature is proof of origin** isn't selected.

10. In **Security**, add the Computer Account for the server where you install the Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector.
    * Allow this account **Read** and **Enroll** permissions.
11. Select **Apply**, then **OK** to save the certificate template.
12. Close the **Certificate Templates Console**.
13. From the **Certification Authority** console, right-click **Certificate Templates**, **New**, **Certificate Template to Issue**.
    * Choose the template that you created in the preceding steps, and select **OK**.
14. For the server to manage certificates on behalf of Intune enrolled devices and users, follow these steps:

    a. Right-click the Certification Authority, choose **Properties**.

    b. On the security tab, add the Computer account of the server where you run the Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector.
      * Grant **Issue and Manage Certificates** and **Request Certificates** Allow permissions to the computer account.
15. Sign out of the Enterprise CA.

## Download install and configure the Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector

![ConnectorDownload][ConnectorDownload]

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **All services**, and filter for **Intune**. Select **Microsoft Intune**, and then select **Device Configuration**. 
2. Select **Certification Authority**, select **Add**, and then select **Download the Connector file**. Save the download to a location where you can access it from the server where it will be installed. 
3. Sign in to this server, and run the installer: 

    1. Accept the default location. It installs the connector to `\Program Files\Microsoft Intune\NDESConnectorUI\NDESConnectorUI.exe`.
    2. In Installer Options, select **PFX Distribution**, and select **Next**.
    3. **Install**, and wait for installation to complete.
    4. When it completes, check **Launch Intune Connector**, and then **Finish**.

4. The NDES Connector window should open to the **Enrollment** tab. To enable the connection to Intune, select **Sign In**, and enter an account with global administrative permissions.
5. On the **Advanced** tab, leave **Use this computer's SYSTEM account (default)** selected.
6. **Apply**, and then **Close**.
7. Go back to the Azure portal (**Intune** > **Device Configuration** > **Certification Authority**). After a few minutes, a green check mark displays, and the **Connection status** is **Active**. Your connector server can now communicate with Intune.

## Create a device configuration profile

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Go to **Intune**, **Device configuration**, **Profiles**, and select **Create profile**.

   ![NavigateIntune][NavigateIntune]

3. Enter the following properties:
   * **Name** for the profile
   * Optionally set a description
   * **Platform** to deploy the profile to
   * Set **Profile type** to **Trusted certificate**

4. Go to **Settings**, and enter the .cer file Root CA Certificate you previously exported.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Depending on the platform you chose in **Step 3**, you may or may not have an option to choose the **Destination store** for the certificate.

   ![ProfileSettings][ProfileSettings]

5. Select **OK**, and then **Create** to save your profile.
6. To assign the new profile to one or more devices, see [How to assign Microsoft Intune device profiles](device-profile-assign.md).

## Create a PKCS Certificate profile

   * **Certification authority** - Displays the internal fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Enterprise CA.
   * **Certification authority name** - Lists the name of your Enterprise CA, and it may be different than the previous item.
   * **Certificate template name** - The name of the template created earlier. Remember **Template name** by default is the same as **Template display name** with *no spaces*.
   * **Subject name format** - Set this option to **Common name** unless otherwise required.
   * **Subject alternative name** - Set this option to **User principal name (UPN)** unless otherwise required.
   * **Extended key usage** - As long as you used the default settings in Step 10 in the [Configure certificate templates on the certification authority](#configure-certificate-templates-on-the-certification-authority) section (in this article), add the following **Predefined values** from the selection:
      * **Any Purpose**
      * **Client Authentication**
      * **Secure Email**
   * **Root Certificate** - (For Android Profiles) Lists the .cer file exported in Step 3 in the [Export the root certificate from the Enterprise CA](#export-the-root-certificate-from-the-enterprise-ca) section (in this article).
