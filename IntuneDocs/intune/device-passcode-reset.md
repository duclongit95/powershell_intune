## Resetting Android for Work passcodes

Supported Android for Work devices receive a new managed profile unlock password or a managed profile challenge for the end user. For devices on Android 7.0 or later with Work profiles, end users receive notifications to activate their reset passcode token immediately after enrollment is completed.
