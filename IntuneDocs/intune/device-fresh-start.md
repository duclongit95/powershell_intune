# Use Fresh Start to reset Windows 10 devices with Intune


[!INCLUDE [azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

The **Fresh Start** device action removes any apps that are installed on a Windows 10 PC that is running the Creators Update. Then, it automatically updates the PC to the latest version of Windows.

This action helps remove pre-installed (OEM) apps that are typically installed with a new PC. To keep the contents of the user's Home folder, and only remove apps and settings, use the `if user data is retained` setting.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Fresh Start unenrolls the device from Intune, but the device is still joined in Azure Active Directory.

## Use Fresh Start

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Choose **All services**, filter on **Intune**, and select **Microsoft Intune**.
3. Select **Devices**, and then select **All devices**.
4. From the list of devices you manage, choose a Windows 10 desktop device, and then select **Fresh Start**.

## Next steps

To see the status of this action, select **Device actions** (**Microsoft Intune** > **Devices**).
