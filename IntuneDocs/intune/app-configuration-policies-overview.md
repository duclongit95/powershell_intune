# App configuration policies for Microsoft Intune

Use app configuration policies in Microsoft Intune to provide configuration settings for an iOS or Android app. These configuration settings allow an app to be customized. You do not assign these configuration policies directly to users and devices. Instead, you associate a configuration policy with an app, and then assign the app. The configuration policy settings are used when the app checks for them, typically the first time it is run.

You can assign an app configuration policy to a group of users and devices by using a combination of include and exclude assignments. Once you add an app configuration policy, you can set the assignments for the app configuration policy. When you set the assignments for the policy, you can choose to include and exclude the groups of users for which the policy applies. When you choose to include one or more groups, you can choose to select specific groups to include or select built-in groups. Built-in groups include **All Users**, **All Devices**, and **All Users + All Devices**.

For example, an app might require you to specify any of the following details:

- A custom port number
- Language settings
- Security settings
- Branding settings such as a company logo

If users enter these settings incorrectly, it can increase the burden on your help desk and slow the adoption of new apps.

App configuration policies can help you eliminate these problems by letting you assign these settings to users in a policy before they run the app. The settings are then supplied automatically, and users need to take no action.

The configuration settings are used whenever the app checks for them. Typically, an app checks for configuration settings the first time the app is run by the user.

You have two options for how to use app configurations with Intune:
 - **Managed devices** - The device is managed by Intune as the mobile device management (MDM) provider.
 - **Managed apps** - An app is managed without device enrollment.

## Apps that support app configuration

You can use app configuration polices for apps that support it. To support app configuration in Intune, apps must have been written to support the use of app configurations. Consult your app vendor for details.

You can prepare your line-of-business apps by either incorporating the Intune App SDK into the app, or wrapping the app after it is developed. The Intune App SDK,available for both iOS and Android, enables your app for Intune app configuration policies. It strives to minimize the amount of code changes required from the app developer. For more information, see the [Intune App SDK overview](app-sdk.md).

## Graph API support for app configuration

Additionally, you can use Graph API to accomplish app configuration tasks. For details, see [Graph API Reference MAM Targeted Config](https://graph.microsoft.io/docs/api-reference/beta/api/intune_mam_targetedmanagedappconfiguration_create).
