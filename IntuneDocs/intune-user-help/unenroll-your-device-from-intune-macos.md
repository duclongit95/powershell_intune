# Unenroll your macOS device from Intune

When you unenroll your macOS device from Intune, your device is no longer able to access company resources.

Follow these steps to unenroll your macOS device from management:

1.  In the Company Portal app, under **My Devices**, select the device you want to unenroll.

2.  Click  **Remove** > **Remove**.

When you unenroll your device from Intune, here's what happens:

-   Your device doesn’t appear in the Company Portal.

-   You can’t install apps from the Company Portal.

-   Any settings that were changed on your device when you added it (like password length) no longer apply.

-   You might not have access to some company resources, such as file shares or internal web sites, on your device anymore.

-   You can’t use company apps and company data on your device anymore.

-   You might not be able to connect to your company network using Wi-Fi or a virtual private network (VPN) anymore.

-   Company email access may be removed from the device.
