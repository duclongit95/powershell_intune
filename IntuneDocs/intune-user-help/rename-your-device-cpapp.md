# Rename device from the Company Portal app for Windows
Rename a device to make it easier to recognize from other devices. The Company Portal app for Windows lets you rename connected Windows, iOS, and Android devices. 

To rename a device:
1. Open the Company Portal app.
2. In the **My devices** section, select the device you want to rename.
3. In the top, right-corner of the page, select the **Rename** icon. 
4. Type in the new name and click **Rename**. You'll see the device name update immediately in the app.
