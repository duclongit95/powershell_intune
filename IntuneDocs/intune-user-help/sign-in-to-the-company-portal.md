# How do I sign in to the Company Portal app? <!--User Story 1132123-->

You use the Company Portal app to access your company resources, like email and business apps. There are two main ways that you can sign in to the Company Portal:

* Using your work email address and password
* Signing in from another device

Even though the following pictures are for iOS, the process is virtually identical for your Android and Windows devices.

## Signing in with your email address and password

1. Open the Company Portal app on your device and tap **Sign In**.

Underneath is the text "Get access to company resources and keep them secure," and the "Sign in" button.

   Don't have the Company Portal app? Find out how to install and download it for [iOS](install-and-sign-in-to-the-intune-company-portal-app-ios.md) or [Android](install-the-company-portal-app-android.md).

2. Enter your **Work or school account** and tap **Next**.

   ![The user is prompted to provide just their email address rather than their email and password on the same screen.](/intune-user-help/media/cp_ios_aad_signin_after_1804_002.png)

3. Enter your password and tap **Sign In**.

   ![The user is prompted for their password after their email address has been accepted.](/intune-user-help/media/cp_ios_aad_signin_after_1804_003.png)

4. After the Company Portal accepts your login, it signs you in and you can begin to access your company resources.

## Signing in with certificate-based authentication

1.	Open the Company Portal app on your device.

2.	Enter your **Work or school account**.

3.	Tap the **Sign in with a certificate** link.

4.	Tap **Continue** to use the certificate.

## Signing in from another device

If you do not use a password to sign in to your company resources, you might use another device as the way to confirm you're the right person with the right levels of access. If your company uses smartcards to access your computers, it's likely that you have to sign in using another device.

1. Instead of entering in your email address, select the **Sign in from another device** link underneath the email text box.

   ![The Company Portal sign in page prompts user for email adress.  Underneath is the "Next" button and a link to "Sign in from another device." Also includes a link to "Can't access your account?" A link at the bottom leads to Microsoft Privacy and Cookies information.](/intune-user-help/media/cp_ios_aad_signin_after_1804_005.png)

2. You receive a unique, one-time code to sign in to the Company Portal.

   ![Instructions are provided to go to the https://microsoft.com/devicelogin page, with a unique passcode, from your work computer, then to use the code to sign in.](/intune-user-help/media/cp_ios_aad_signin_after_1804_006.png)

3. On your other device, open your browser and go to [https://microsoft.com/devicelogin](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin) to enter the code.

4. Once the **Device Login** page verifies the code, select __Continue__ to allow the Company Portal to sign in on your other device.

   ![The user has input their unique code into the field, and the "Device login" site has asked for confirmation that the Intune Company Portal was the correct app to receive authorization to sign in.](/intune/media/cp_ios_aad_signin_from_another_device_after_1704_005.png)

5. Once the code is verified, you can close the window.

   ![A confirmation page that states that the user has now signed into the Company Portal app on their device, and that this page can be closed.](/intune/media/cp_ios_aad_signin_from_another_device_after_1704_006.png)

6. On your original device, the Company Portal app begins signing in.
