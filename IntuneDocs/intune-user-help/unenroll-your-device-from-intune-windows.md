## Removing your personal information after removing the Company Portal
There are two kinds of data that the Company Portal stores on your Windows device:

-	**Diagnostic logs**: Standard app activity data that Microsoft collects. This is automatically erased when you uninstall the Company Portal app. App activity data is, for example, data about how long the app was open or if the app crashed.
-	**Application cache**: Support files that are required for the app to work, such as icons and settings.

To delete the stored logs and cache, complete one of the following steps:

* [Uninstall the Company Portal app](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4028003/windows-10-uninstall-apps-and-programs) 

* Reset the Company Portal app. Open the **Settings** app and select > **Apps** > **Company Portal** > **Advanced options** > **Reset**.
