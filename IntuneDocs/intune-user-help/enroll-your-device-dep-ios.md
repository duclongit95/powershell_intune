# Enroll your iOS device in Intune with the Device Enrollment Program

The Device Enrollment Program is offered by Apple to make it easier for companies to manage large numbers of iOS devices. If your company allowed you to bring your own device, you follow the [regular iOS enrollment steps](enroll-your-device-in-intune-ios.md) rather than the steps on this page. Read on if your company provided you with an iOS device and told you that it was part of the Device Enrollment Program.

1. Turn on your iOS device. 
2. After you select your **Language**, connect your device to Wi-Fi.
3. On the **Set up iOS device** screen, choose whether you want to: 
 
   - **Set up as new device**
   - **Restore from iCloud backup**
   - **Restore from iTunes backup**

4. Once youâ€™ve connected to Wi-Fi, the **Configuration** screen will appear. This will say that **[Your Company] will automatically configure your device.**

   **Configuration allows [Your Company] to manage this device over the air. An administrator can help you set up email and network accounts, install and configure apps, and manage settings remotely. An administrator may disable features, install and remove apps, monitor and restrict your Internet traffic and remotely erase this device.**
 
   **Configuration is provided by:
   [Your Company's] iOS Team
   [Address]**

5. Log in with your Apple ID. Logging in lets you install the Company Portal app and install the management profile that will let your company give you access to their resources, like email and apps. 
6. Agree to the **Terms and Conditions** and decide whether you want to send diagnostic information to Apple.
7. Once you complete your enrollment, your device may prompt you to take more actions. Some of these steps might be entering your password for email access or setting up a passcode.
