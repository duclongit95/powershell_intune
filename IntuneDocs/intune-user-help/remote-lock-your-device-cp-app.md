# Lock your device from Company Portal app for Windows 10

Remotely lock a lost or stolen device from the Company Portal app for Windows 10. If supported on your device, the Company Portal app will lock your device's screen--no matter where it is. A passcode will be required to unlock it.

Remote lock is supported on devices running:

* Android
* iOS
* macOS
* Windows 10 Mobile (if the device already had a passcode set)
* Windows Phone 8.1 (if the device already had a passcode set)

1. From the **Home** page of the Company Portal app, go to **My Devices** and select the device that you want to lock.

2. On the **Device details** page, select the **Remote lock** icon.

3. Select **Lock** to confirm that you want to lock the device. The app will attempt to lock your device and redirect you to the Home page.

4. Should you find your device, enter your passcode to unlock it.
