# Docs.microsoft.com Github repository

You've found one of the GitHub repositories that houses the source for content published to [https://docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/.), home of all technical content for Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise Division.

## Contribute to your documentation
We **want and encourage contributions** from our community (users, customers, partners) and Microsoft employees to improve your documentation. Here are some tips:

* **Create a GitHub account**: Sign up is free at [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com).

* **Use your browser**: If you're familiar with GitHub, then find the article in this repository, and make your updates. Or, go to the article on [https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/), and select the **Edit** link. This opens the GitHub source for the article. Then, just use the GitHub UI within your web browser to make your updates. 

  When you make an update, you may be prompted to sign a license agreement. This is a one-time task. So any future updates by your GitHub username won't need to sign again. 
  
* **MSFT Employees**: After you create a GitHub account, link it to your Microsoft email address. When your account is linked, you don't have to sign a license agreement to make an update. Steps:

  1. On a device with corpnet, go to [GitHub account setup](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-get-started-setup-github?branch=master). If you're not on corpnet, this link returns a 404.
  
    Creating a GitHub account, and linking to your Microsoft account is a one-time thing. When your account is linked, you don't have to sign a license agreement to make an update. 

  2. In your browser, go to the article, and select **Edit**. Switch to the private repo (IntuneDocs-pr):  
    **From**: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/IntuneDocs/...  
    **To**: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/IntuneDocs-pr/...
  
  3. Select the pencil icon, and make your changes.
